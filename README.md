# Tek1_TLDR

A quick and brief recap' of my first year at Epitech.

## What is TLDR

It just stands for Too Long; Didn't Read. Because not all projects of the year are / were interesting,
so I'm keeping the one I liked the most.

### Please remember

All those projects where from a time I was still learning how to develop and be a better CS engineer,
most of the code is left untouched. I will maybe add comments to justify my point of view / my idea at the time, but I will not modify a single line of code.

> Even I am ashamed of the decisions I took in the past, but I can understand the logic I had at the time.

## IF YOU ARE AN EPITECH STUDENT

I can't refrain you from checking on my code to get ideas. You are an adult and responsible for what you do.
If you however still decide to copy/paste or get inspiration from my sources, at least write every line by yourself, you get to spent time with the code to better understand it.
